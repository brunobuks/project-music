Not Good Enough For Truth In Cliche

Hurtful words
From my enemies of the last five years
What's it like to die alone?
How does it feel when tears freeze
When you cry?
The blood in your veins is twenty below

Sitting in this room playing russian roulette
Finger on the trigger to my dear juliet
Out from the window see your back drop silhouette
This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget

//---

So for now, take this down a notch
Crash my car through your window
Make sure you're still alive
Just in time to kill you

Sitting in this room playing russian roulette
Finger on the trigger to my dear juliet
Out from the window see your back drop silhouette
This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget
Something I cannot forget

//---

I can't take this (take) anymore
I can't take this (take) anymore
(I cannot feel what you've done to me
What you've done to me)
I can't take this (take) anymore
I can't take this (take) anymore
So for now, take this down a notch
Crash my car through your window, window

Sitting in this room playing Russian roulette

Out from the window see her back drop silhouette
This blood on my hands is something I cannot forget
Something I cannot forget
